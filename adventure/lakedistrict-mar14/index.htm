    <h2>Info/notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Going to need to have:
        <ul>
          <li>Boots</li>
          <li>Tent (these can be heavy, and carrying a popup is probably not practical)</li>
          <li>Food/drink (ration packs are pretty good)</li>
          <li>Cooking equipment (hexamine stoves are about a fiver with enough fuel for the weekend, you will need pans and stuff)</li>
          <li>Change of clothes and warm/waterproof stuff (but not your whole fucking wardrobe!)</li>
          <li>Sleeping bag</li>
          <li>Decent bag to carry it all in</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This could be a lot of weight for some people - think about what you pack (you probably don't need that kitchen sink)</li>
      <li>It might be wet/miserable. I hope not, but do bear that in mind. Might be worth putting all your stuff in waterproof bags before it goes in your backpack.</li>
      <li>Total cost is £22, plus change for parking and ferry.
        <ul>
          <li>£10 fuel</li>
          <li>£12 camping fee</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
