			About me
		</h1>
		<p>
			I'm a front-end developer by profession, but I like to get my claws into anything that excites me - whether that be chemistry, programming or generally exploring in any form.
		</p>
		<p>
			My bread and butter is CSS and HTML, I also like to play with JavaScript and JQuery - as well as anything new that catches my eye. I especially like the challenge of responsive design and learning new web technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm also into amateur rocketry, something I carried over from my love of chemistry. I've always enjoyed practical chemistry, and persued it academically alongside computing for a time, before my love of building web projects took over and I went to full time computing.
		<p>
			I spend a lot of my time outdoors, camping, climbing and hiking, as well as a bit of <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=urban+exploration" title="Google urban exploration">urban exploration</a>. I like exploring new places, and do whenever I get the chance, whether it be hills in Wales or a loch in the highlands of Scotland.
