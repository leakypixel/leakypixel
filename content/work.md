# Work
A few examples of things I've worked on and the technologies involved. This page
is very much a work-in-progress!

## "Serverless" eCommerce
Worked on a high-profile project for a well-known international clothing brand,
using React, Netlify, Next.js, AWS lambda, nodeJS and AWS dynamoDB to deliver an
integrated customer experience across in-store devices, mobile websites and a
facebook messenger bot. Working remotely as part of a small, internationally 
distributed team to deliver a time-critical project with many challenges and
tight deadlines.

## Fleet and inventory control
Worked closely with a worldwide distributed team to develop a deliveroo-like
service for fuel and related product delivery. As the only JavaScript developer
on the team, I built a react and apollo based web application to interact with 
an erlang graphql service that was being developed in tandem by other members 
of the team.
