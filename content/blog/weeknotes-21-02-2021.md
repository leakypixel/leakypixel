# Weeknotes ending 21-02-2021

* Finished the designs for my mushroom growing and fruiting chamber and ordered
  the required parts. I'm quite excited to get on with this, once again using
  ESP8266 boards.

* Tested some salvaged small appliances, including a wall-mounted hand dryer.
  Sadly I got no hits on these and they don't look easily fixable, I could take
  them fully apart and probably work out what's wrong, but right now my time is
  at a premium and it's not worth the effort.
  
* Birthday and valentines day were both enjoyable despite lockdown, though I'm
  pretty eager to be able to see my friends properly (and go camping). I'm
  starting to hear lots of vaccines getting administered, so maybe this is
  the last lockdown for a while but I'm not too hopeful.
  
* Started preparing the greenhouse for spring, including some bell siphons and
  hard piping rather than the flexible silicone hose I used last year.

* Picked up some ex-solar-farm panels, they look to be very good quality and I'm
  expecting to get them onto the shed roof once I've got the EPDM covering on.
  That'll free up the solar panels currently used for the shed to go on the
  greenhouse system, hopefully meaning I can run some small heaters to protect
  the plants from the cold and grow for further into autumn.
  
* The painful off-main-thread work is finally complete - I've learned a lot from
  this about the weirdities off cross-thread communication in JS and it's made
  a noticable difference to the felt responsiveness of the UI in my tests. It's
  a big win, but was a rocky road.
