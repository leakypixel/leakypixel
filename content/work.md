# Work
A few examples of things I've worked on and some of the technologies involved.
My work has been quite varied and I'm always looking to expand into new areas of
technology, especially in that little space between hardware and software.

## Cross-platform development
*Vue, Capacitor, Quasar, Desktop app, Mobile app, Responsive Website, UI
Design/Development, NodeJS, Restify, MongoDB, API Design/Development*

Worked as the sole developer on a cross-platform scheduling app for shift
pattern scheduling. Used Quasar with Vue and Capacitor to develop a
single-codebase cross-platform app, and accompanying microservices for auth,
sync and storage.

## "Serverless" eCommerce
*React, Netlify, NextJS, Lambda, DynamoDB, TypeScript, Messenger Platform, Mobile Website, API Design/Development*

Worked on a high-profile project for a well-known international clothing brand,
using React, Netlify, NextJS, AWS lambda, nodeJS and AWS dynamoDB to deliver an
integrated customer experience across in-store devices, mobile websites and a
facebook messenger bot.

## Custom IoT development
*Linux, SBC/Raspberry Pi, High Reliability, Data Security, Integrated Appliance
Design, React, Docker/Compose, Grafana*

Worked with a series A startup to produce a custom-designed device for secure
decommissioning and backup of spinning disk drives, designed to be moved from
site to site and provided clustered reports and alerts via a central dashboard.

## Fleet and inventory control
*React, Apollo, Elixir, Phoenix, LeafletJS, UI Design/Development, GraphQL,
Docker/Compose*

Worked closely with a worldwide distributed team to develop a deliveroo-like
service for fuel and related product delivery. As the only JavaScript developer
on the team, I built a react and apollo based web application to interact with 
an erlang graphql service that was being developed in tandem by other members 
of the team.

## Docker images
*Docker, Jenkins, Docker Hub*

I maintain a few docker images over on docker hub, some of which get around
~100K pulls each version. Where appropriate, they're set up with repository
links and external build services. The containerized apps themselves range from
pulseaudio (system service) to jenkins (complex web app).
