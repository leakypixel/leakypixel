Hi, my name's Craig Fletcher. I hack things together from code, cables, yaml
files and other assorted items I have lying around. I frequently use
technologies such as JavaScript, Docker, Python and Linux, and advocate for
things being as open as possible. I sometimes write on my [blog](/blog), tweet
at [leakypixel](//twitter.com/leakypixel) and work on projects on my
[github](//github.com/leakypixel).
