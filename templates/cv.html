    <p>I've been developing for the web for around 7 years and I'm
    still as eager as ever to push my skills and learn new things.
    I specialise in JavaScript (both front and back end) and have a
    penchant for getting the best performance out of applications
    and workflows.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p><em>2016</em></p>
      <h3>The Hut Group - JavaScript developer, Contract (3 months,
      renewed 4 times)</h3>
      <p>Worked on both internal and external projects (Honda/The
      Daily Mail group), including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of githook-based commit quality
        checking</li>
        <li>Componentisation of an existing codebase</li>
        <li>Full site builds</li>
        <li>NodeJS-based CMS APIs</li>
        <li>Rework and performance improvements of an existing
        site</li>
        <li>Integration of CMS into existing site</li>
        <li>Development of a custom CMS in Angular 2</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>2015</em></p>
      <h3>Bet365 - JavaScript developer, Contract (6 months)</h3>
      <p>Helping rebuild the front end of the Bet365 site in HTML5,
      CSS and TypeScript. In particular, I contributed to the build
      system, including linting, autoformatting and code style
      checking. Using the build system, we were able to greatly cut
      down time spent in code reviews and reduce the number of bugs
      making it through to testing.</p>
      <p><em>2013 - 2015</em></p>
      <h3>On The Beach ltd. - Front end developer, Permanent</h3>
      <p>Working on a travel search and booking website visited by
      thousands of people all over the UK on a daily basis, plus
      foreign-marketed versions of the same functionality. I was
      the first member of the front end team at On The Beach ltd.,
      and during my 2 years there, I helped bring about many
      changes in the way that the front end of the sites were
      handled - such as strict coding guidelines and a
      componentisation of our legacy SCSS, HTML/ERB and
      JavaScript.</p>
      <p><em>2011 - 2013</em></p>
      <h3>CSI Media - Developer, Permanent</h3>
      <p>Building a wide range of websites for clients, and hooking
      them into a proprietary back-end travel system. This involved
      a vast array of skills, and I found it to be quite exciting -
      one week I could be working on a mobile site for a specialist
      holiday company, another I could be working on a responsive
      corporate site for a hovercraft company (this actually
      happened, and it was great). Most of my work here revolved
      around HTML and CSS, with only a little JavaScript - this set
      me on a path to discovering and developing my passion for
      JavaScript both in work and in my spare time.</p>
      <p><em>2010 - 2011</em></p>
      <h3>CDL - Desktop Processing Developer, Permanent</h3>
      <p>Taking insurance documents and turning them into
      syntactically correct/standards compliant HTML markup, giving
      careful consideration to the heirarchy of the information -
      making sure the important parts looked important. I learned a
      lot about syntactic markup here, and the structure of HTML -
      which I think is something often glossed over. I've since
      built on this knowledge, by learning about accessability and
      how the structure and syntax of HTML affects technologies
      such as crawlers and screen readers.</p>

      <h2>I'm not boring</h2>
      <p>I have quite a few hobbies outside of my development work,
      and try to keep myself as active as I can - especially during
      the summer, when I can get outside.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rock climbing and bouldering are my big hobbies...
        though they don't look a lot different from the outside,
        there's quite a gap. I vary between the two, but practice
        indoors twice a week and get outside when I can.</li>
        <li>Somehow I ended up being a Scout leader, too. I was
        part of the organisation when I was younger, and after a
        couple of years break, I went back to help out. It has
        greatly helped me in maintaining leadership skills, and
        organising larger groups of people.</li>
        <li>I also spend quite a lot of my free time tinkering and
        working on personal projects, such as building raspberry pi
        based camera systems, monitors, or arcade systems.</li>
        <li>To keep up with the fast-paced world of development, I
        spend quite a lot of my free time reading, or listening to
        podcasts. Some of my favourites are 99 percent invisible,
        late night linux, user error, and project bouldering.</li>
      </ul>
