# Weeknotes ending 24-01-2021

### Yep, I'm jumping on the bandwagon.

I've been keeping a daily standup with myself for the past couple of months now,
and I've found it immensely helpful in focusing on priorities rather than
getting distracted by incidental productivity.

Having seen a few people I follow starting weeknotes lately, I thought it might
be worth a go. I'm not sure if it'll end up being useful or just another chore,
but I'll keep it up for a few weeks and decide from there.


### On with the show

* Did some crypto work on the side for a couple of small ERC20 projects, I've
  learned quite a bit about contract interaction from JS through doing these
  over the past few months, but the returns are diminishing significantly by
  now.

* Bottled up my second (late harvest) cider having let it sit for a few weeks in
  the cold. I gave it a taste just before bottling and while it's still got
  those not-sat-for-long-enough yeasty and alcohol smells, it's very promising.
  This is my first year of "production" cider making after experimenting last
  year. I'm very pleased with the results so far.
  
* I carried on my work on the garden and house, it's been very tiring and the
  progress is slower than I'd like due to weather and time constraints, but the
  improvement is visible and the list is noticably shorter than it was a couple of
  weeks ago. I put this almost entirely down to my current "one thing from the
  list per day" target.
  
* Recently, I've also done some research into World War 2 bomb shelters, fuel
  infrastructure and other related things. I've managed to locate the sites of 2
  sealed off shelters in my town from this research, as well as a few structures
  of note around my local area. I plan to continue this for a while as I'm
  finding it far more interesting than I expected.
