# Weeknotes ending 14-02-2021

These weeknotes are a little late, as I've had a bit of a tough week. Still,
better late than never.

* I managed to get quite a bit done in the garden, from planting a few things to
  getting rid of a lot of rocks and other assorted flotsam. The garden looks
  better for it, but there's still a way to go. I should get quite a few flowers
  this year as it'll be year three after planting some native wildflowers.
  
* Completed a few bugfixes on my home network infrastructure - retained MQTT
  messages, installation of an new additional UPS, that sort of thing. I think
  I'm about 50% complete with the home automation stuff, but waiting on various
  things to be installed first which each have their own dependencies.
  
* Tested a new design for an inline beer cooler, which worked but didn't provide
  as much cooling as I was looking for. Back to the drawing board with this one
  - maybe stacking peltiers would work better.

* First full-roof repairs on the garage roof - it's been a nightmare and
  continues to develop leaks, so I'm following advice from a friend and brushed
  on some cement-based substance that will then get a layer of tar-like roofing
  sealant. I am tired of this problem.
