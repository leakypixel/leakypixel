# Hi, I'm Craig Fletcher, a front-end and JavaScript developer based in North West England.

I mostly hack things together in JavaScript, CSS and HTML
both as a contractor and freelance, as well as my own projects
from time to time. I've worked in the industry for around 7
years, and have been lucky enough to work with some great
clients on amazing projects. Take a look around and see what
I've been doing lately, or drop me an email at [hi@leakypixel.net](mailto:hi@leakypixel.net).

I next have availability from the 20th of July, for 3 days a week.
