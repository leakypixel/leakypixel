# Weeknotes ending 31-01-2021

* Having bottled and now racked all the cider for the year, I've now cleaned and
  packed all the relevant equipment away. I'm using milk crates to rack my
  bottles, which fit 20 standard size bottles and stack neatly. I'm very pleased
  with this setup.

* I finally managed to finish the ansible work for my home CCTV system, and
  managed to get all 5 cameras installed and operational. I still want to tweak
  some of the motion detection settings and exact angles of the cameras, but
  they've already come in useful to check who's at the door or watch the
  neighbourhood cats in the back garden.
  
* Managed to keep up the work on the house and garden, which has gone very well
  barring a wall-mounted knife rack that caused me a lot of anguish mounting
  only to find that it didn't meet my requirements and so was taken down. The
  patch on the wall has been filled and now needs repainting, which is a bit
  disheartening.
  
* Having got the CCTV system up and running, my next house tech task is
  multisensors. I have a few different sets of requirements for these, depending
  on their location and power source, but selected the simplest model that would
  grant me benefit as the first device to produce and test. It's a weatherproof
  acrylic junction box intended to be mounted on the side of the house, with
  motion, light intensity, pressure, humidity, temperature and rain sensors. The
  main build is finished with only a mesh grille left to attach, then just
  requires mounting and service testing.

* I found out about reflowing text in a vim buffer with `gqG`. I can't believe
  I didn't find this out sooner, I've found myself using it a lot.
