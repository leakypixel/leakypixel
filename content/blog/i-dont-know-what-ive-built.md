# I don't know what I've built

It started as a code kata - implement some common operations in a simple,
functional way and run them in a configurable order on some data. What it turned
into I'm not sure I have a good name for, perhaps a functional pipeline runner? 
Unable to properly label this creation, I decided on the name [grapefruit](https://github.com/leakypixel/grapefruit) because
I'd learned that a [grapefruit is a hybrid
fruit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit#History) earlier that day and it had
stuck in my mind. 

There are many better ways of doing whatever you would use grapefruit for - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a static site, spreadsheets or scripts for transforming data - but
that's not the point. I didn't build grapefruit with the intention of producing
a quality solution for a specific problem, I built it simply for fun. I do use
it to generate this site and also for various board or table-top game related
things, something which it works _fine_ for, but that's mostly just because I
wanted to throw a problem at the solution and see how well it worked.

## Why would you do this?
Okay, so this is the real point of this post - to code for fun, making something
that anyone else is unlikely to use and developing without pressure from myself
or anyone else. I think that having projects like this is important in whatever
hobby you also do in service - for example, I love cooking for other people and
do so a few times a week. The enjoyment of this hasn't yet faded for me, but
every one or two weeks I'll take time out to produce something just for me
that's entirely experimental - something that I can do without expectations.
It's about the process itself and exploring an idea without worrying whether
anyone will like it, or if it's even a good idea.

For me, I feel these projects help prevent poisoning the well when it comes to
coding: I often work on projects with demanding deadlines, and projects like
this help remind me that programming isn't all pressure and JIRA tickets - it
can still be fun.
