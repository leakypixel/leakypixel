## Hi, my name's Craig Fletcher. I play with tech for hobby and for hire.

I work with code, cables, yaml files and whatever else I need to get the job done - frequently using technologies such as JavaScript, Docker, Python and Linux all the way from IoT to cloud. Projects I've worked on have ranged from ecommerce sites for multinational retailers to bespoke hardware solutions for series A startups.

You can email me using `hi` at this domain, otherwise, you can find my content at the following places and contact me on some of them. I always like to hear from people so feel free to say hi!
