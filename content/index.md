Hi, my name's Craig Fletcher. I hack things together from code, cables, yaml
files and other assorted items I have lying around. I frequently use
technologies such as JavaScript, Docker, Python and Linux, and advocate for
things being as open as possible. 

After years of neglect, I've started to rebuild this site from scratch. You can
see how I'm getting on with that on the [github
repository](https://github.com/leakypixel/leakypixel) or read my blog post about
it [here](/blog/creating-this-site).
